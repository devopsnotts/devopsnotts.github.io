  topic: Devel-ops - Bringing development practices to operations tasks
  description: DevOps starts to deliver more value when it moves beyond breaking down team communication walls and the sharing of best practice starts to happen from all sides. In this talk Jonathan Relf discusses how “infrastructure as code” can help you build secure, up to date environments consciously & collaboratively. You will be introduced to some of the methods and tools he has used to automate and test building virtual machines. He illustrates this with his own career journey from a Developer moving into Operations and the benefits these approaches have brought.
